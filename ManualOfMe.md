## Who I am and how to work with me
### Personality

I love **solving problems.** My passion for problem-solving extends beyond professional challenges — it's a fundamental part of who I am. Whether it's guessing a murderer in a detective novel, tackling puzzles, or designing solutions for unique business challenges, I'm driven by the satisfaction of finding an elegant solution.

I love to **make everything more efficient.** Optimization is not just a professional skill for me; it's a life philosophy. It can be workload cost optimization, architecture simplification, or wardrobe organization — I can't resist optimizing.

I love **structure.**  My appreciation for structured thinking is inspired by the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle from my university days. By breaking down challenges into clear logical components, I can navigate even the most complex scenarios with clarity.

I love **learning.**  I view the world as an endless classroom, where every interaction, project, and challenge presents an opportunity to expand my knowledge. Stagnation is my greatest fear — I'm constantly seeking new insights, technologies, and perspectives that can enhance my understanding and capabilities.

### Why I like being an architect

As a developer, writing code was always engaging, and I still enjoy diving into the "boiler room" to support development teams. However, being a developer has limitations. It constrains you to narrow technical implementation, whereas being a Solutions Architect allows me to see the entire landscape, not just a single piece of the puzzle. In this role, I can:

- Understand broader organizational challenges
- Transform business objectives into technical requirements
- Design architectures with the best combination of trade-offs

### Preferred channels of communication
I’m a big fan of deep work and flow, so I try to be very intentional about how we communicate:

- Meetings: I actually enjoy them when we’re brainstorming or tackling a complex architectural "puzzle" together. If there’s a clear goal and an agenda, count me in!
- Daily updates: For quick updates or status checks, let’s stick to chats. It keeps a paper trail for our decisions and doesn't break anyone's concentration.
- [No-hello](https://nohello.net/en/): Feel free to jump straight to your question. It saves us both a few round trips and lets me get you an answer quicker.
